# Rational

Maybe I am just tired of coffee script compiler.  Maybe python is a better platform then node.  Maybe i am just spoild being able to run same on on the client as on the server.  I just want coffee script to be python.

Python to javascript landsape is graveyard unfinished compilers.  Why not take a compiler thats simple and have a good number of tests and try to breathe some life into it.  This is what I have done with Niall McCarroll compiler.

# Runnings

python pystorm.py file.py > file.js
